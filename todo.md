## Bug:
- Alert for compname.css.map on react
- min height for header(specially when just title is showing)

## Features:
- Documents: scrollable code segments on mobile
- Unique id/class
- Back with escape button

## Future:
- Close on mobile back(optional)
- Bold typed characters in search
- Nested options(update on fly)
